# BiometricSystems-FaceAnonymization

Abstract: In today's digitized world, everyone leaves information on the Internet that can be used to identify the specific person. In this paper, we give an overview of common techniques for anonymizing facial images. The implementations consist of different methods to anonymize faces, as well as execute them with different strengths. The experiment results show that the higher the level of anonymization, the harder it is to recognize the person and the more encrypted the private information of our biometric data we leave in the world.
Keywords: biometrics, privacy, face recognition, anonymisation, computer vision, GAN, Neural Networks.
